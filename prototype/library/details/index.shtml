                    The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the
                    Turing Machine
                </div>
                <h4 class="text-secondary">by <span class="text-underlined">Charles Petzold</span></h4>
                <div class="book-details__description">
                    <p>
                        Mathematician Alan Turing invented an imaginary computer known as the Turing
                        Machine; in an age before computers, he explored the concept of what it meant
                        to be "computable," creating the field of computability theory in the process, a
                        foundation of present-day computer programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The book expands Turing's original 36-page paper with additional background
                        chapters and extensive annotations; the author elaborates on and clarifies
                        many of Turing's statements, making the original difficult-to-read document
                        accessible to present day programmers, computer science majors, math geeks,
                        and others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interwoven into the narrative are the highlights of Turing's own life: his years at
                        Cambridge and Princeton, his secret work in cryptanalysis during World War II,
                        his involvement in seminal computer projects, his speculations about artificial
                        intelligence, his arrest and prosecution for the crime of "gross indecency," and
                        his early death by apparent suicide at the age of 41. (less)
